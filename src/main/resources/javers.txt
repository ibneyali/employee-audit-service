Explored tools for object versioning and changelog tracking.
JaVers is recommended as it provides a complete framework for capturing object snapshots, computing diffs, and maintaining history over time.
It can be integrated with Spring AOP, where AOP handles interception (when and where to audit), and JaVers manages versioning (what changed and how).
This combination provides a robust and flexible audit mechanism for domain objects.

Aspect	Spring AOP	JaVers
Purpose	Handles cross-cutting concerns via method interception.	Tracks and versions object changes with diffs.
Focus	Execution logic – when and where to run code.	Data changes – what changed and who changed it.
Output	Logs or triggers after method execution.	JSON/structured object diffs and snapshots.
Storage	No built-in persistence.	Stores snapshots in SQL/Mongo.
Integration	Intercepts service methods.	Used inside intercepted methods for auditing.
